# Coding Stable Diffusion from Scratch

> Like my previous implementation, this repo is a code follow-along excercise by the [excellent tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI) by Umar Jamil `@hkproj`. He read more than 30 papers for the 5-hour video tutorial, which is already incredible. 

The goal of this repo is to 
- Increase my and the reader's understanding Diffusion models 
- Develop a visual representation as a flowchart of the entire repository. The previous flowchart on LLaMA2 gathered a lot of encouragement, so why not!
