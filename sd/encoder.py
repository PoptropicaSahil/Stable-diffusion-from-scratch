        Idea is to compress the image i.e. reduce the shape, but keep adding more features/channels. 
        So each pixel carries more information with more features.
        This variational autoencoder not only compresses the image, but also 
        LEARNS A LATENT SPACE i.e. learns a DISTRIBUTION. 

        Learn the mu, sigma of the latent space.
        We can then sample from this distribution.
